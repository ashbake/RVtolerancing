# RVtolerancing
HISPEC RV tolerancing tools

Quick dump of tools that use the Zemax model of HISPEC that is set up with coordinate breaks for tolerancing

The code requires tol_data_file.csv which contains information about the surface numbers and names of the coordinate breaks used to tweak each optic in the desired axis by how much

also orders_*csv files define the order bounds and wavelengths in order to step through each to compute the RV impact across the detector
